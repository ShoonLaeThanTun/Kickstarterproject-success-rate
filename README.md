🎯 Project: Kickstarter Success Prediction using Data Mining
This project uses data mining and classification techniques to predict the success rate of Kickstarter projects based on key project features. The goal is to analyze historical Kickstarter data and build a model that can classify whether a project is likely to succeed or fail.

📊 Objectives
Explore and preprocess Kickstarter dataset

Apply data mining techniques to extract useful insights

Build classification models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, etc.)

Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Identify key features that influence project success

🧠 Technologies & Tools
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM)

Data visualization for insights

📁 Dataset
